# i3-autodisplay-debian

This repository contains the source to build a Debian package for [i3-autodisplay](https://github.com/lpicanco/i3-autodisplay).

## Usage

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed locally, just run the following:

```bash
user@hostname~$ ./build.sh
```
By default this will build i3-autodisplay 0.6 on Debian Buster.

If you want to customize the build at runtime, use the following:

```bash
user@hostname~$ ./build.sh -i debian:unstable-slim -v <version>
```
Don't forget to update `debian/changelog` so your package is generated with the correct version.

## Release

To publish a new package version to Github, follow these steps:
  * update the `VERSION` variable in `build.sh`
  * add a new entry in `debian/changelog`
  * create a new tag with the Debian package version
